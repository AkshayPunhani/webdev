What is your experience with web architecture. Have you written HTML before? Written JavaScript? etc.

I've basic experience when it comes to web architecture but since I haven't done it for the past 3-4 years, I'd say I'm pretty much a newbie to this. 

What are your favorite features from at least 2 browsers?

Safari - I love the "Add page to reading list feature". It's accessible and convenient for adding pages which are important. 

Chrome - Love the fact that there are so many apps on chrome store, which provide so many amazing features for practically everything.
